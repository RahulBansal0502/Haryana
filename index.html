          <h2>Art and Culture of Haryana</h2>
          <p>
            Haryana is one of the unique states in the country having developed culture and developing economy. It's culture is deeply rooted in a pluralistic ethos of age -old histroy providing creative expression, value- sustenance and belief
            patterns to thousands of communities which constitute the contemporary Indian Society.Haryana also occupies an important place on the cultural map of India. Haryana is proud of a rich cultural heritage that goes way back to the Vedic
            times. The state is rich in folklore. The people of Haryana have their own traditions. The age old customs of meditation, Yoga and chanting of Vedic Mantras, are still observed by the masses. The seasonal and religious festivals glorify
            the culture of this region. The dance is said to be the mother of all arts. Music and poetry exist in tune, painting and architecture in space. The dance is just not a form of recreation but something needed to release the physical and
            emotional energy. Folk dances, like other creative art, helps in sublimating the performer's worries and cares. Haryana has always been a state of diverse races, cultures and faiths. It is on this soil that they met and fused into
            something truly India. The people of Haryana have preserved their old religious and social traditions. They celebrate festivals with great enthusiasm and traditional fervor. Their culture and popular art are Saangs, dramas, ballads and
            songs in which they take great delight.
            <br />
            With Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu and English forming the main languages, there are numerous dialects which are spoken in Haryana. However, almost all of them have their base in Hindi. Sanskrit is also taught in most of the schools in Haryana. In
            towns and cities, English is still to be adopted as the household lingo, but is spoken in a hazy mixture of Hindi. The most striking feature of Haryana is its language itself; or rather, the manner in which it is spoken. Popularly known
            as Harayanvi, Bangaru or Jatu, it is perhaps a bit crude, but full of earthy humor and straightforwardness. With rapid urbanization, and due to Haryana's close proximity to Delhi, the cultural aspects are now taking a more modern hue.
